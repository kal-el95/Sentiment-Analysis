a life long comic fan, DC characters are more close to my heart than Marvel characters. The first making of this film was just disappointing. It seems like there are bunch of idiots sitting on the WB executive positions who have no vision at all. The first film was literally incomplete. This one tells the full story and I must say nicely. This is the movie we, all the fans wanted and deserve.',\n \"I don't want to discuss the Machiavellian machinations that led to the butchery cut from 2017 and then to this one seeing the light of day - suffice to say that I am not hopeful for the future - yet I am grateful for them leading to me getting to see Zack Snyder's cut. Other than being way too long, it was a pretty perfect film. It would have been a much better business decision to split it into two films and getting twice the money from cinemas than to cut and reshoot it into stupidity.After watching this cut I knew why things happened, what the motivations of the characters were, including the villains, Superman's lip didn't make me cringe, new characters and story ideas have been introduced and I am hopeful for the DC Universe for the first time in a long time. Easter Eggs galore! And it also had a nice end scene that foreshadowed a possible continuation, but also gave enough so you understand what it could have been even if no film is being made of it. It's not a one minute Marvel post credit scene, it's a full on subplot about the future. Hell, it made me want to see more of Jared Leto!Is it perfect? No. There were some scenes that I would have gladly had edited out: people bursting in song like in a Bolly film, people climbing stairs, Lois Lane talking to Clark's mom, Lois Lane talking to a random street cop, Lois Lane standing still thinking, etc. The character of Cyborg's dad was also weak, even if I really like the actor.Bottom line: I thought that the 2017 cut had a bunch of characters that were not explored or otherwise pointless. The Snyder cut fixes all of that and adds meaning to everything everybody does. It's not mindless fun like the 2017, but has a shape and a place in the world and would have given me hope in the DC Universe if I didn't know only AT&T's desperation brought it to light.\",\n \"Zach Snyder's original version is 1000 x's better than the one Joss Whedon put in theaters. DC made a huge mistake not trusting Synder.\",\n 'Yesss, thank you Zack Snyder!\\nTHIS is the movie the DC heroes deserved...\\nAnd the fans as well!It\\'s an amazing continuation on \"Man Of Steel\" and \"Batman V Superman\" and the story is splendid this way. Character arcs, worldbuilding, awesome effects...\\nNote to Warner Bros: let Snyder continue this franchise.\\nHe really knows what he\\'s doing!',\n 'No words can describe the experience. Seeing all the struggle come into life makes it amazing. Hundred times better than the theatrical cut.',\n 'Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize.\\nHonestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film.',\n 'The longer they are, the more time they get to set up the story The pace is perfect The stories of each character is perfectly timed Nothing feels rushed and the dark theme just ups the game Justice has finally been done to the reputation of justice league',\n \"This movie is significantly higher quality. Almost everything they took out was for the better. Almost every change was for the better. The story makes sense. There are legitimate characters with arcs and everything. The visuals are beautiful, the music is beastly. And it is TRULY epic.The only reason I didn't give this a higher score is because, simply put, it's too long. I was never bored. And I always advocate for the artists (directors) creating art without studio interference. But while the original Justice League is one end of the spectrum with studio interference up the butt, this seems like the other end, where the director is a bit overindulgent. Many of the scenes are completely unnecessary to the story and some even feel like deleted scenes from a DVD extra.Again, I was not bored, but rewatchability comes into play when I rate. I definitely want to watch this again, but the 4 hour runtime will significantly reduce repeat viewings. Somewhere in here, there is a 3 hour and 15 minute perfect cut which I would rate 8/10.EDIT: Watching this again, I'm so sad and angry at this studio. There are so many cool things foreshadowed as possible futures in this world. Even years later, I want to see them SO BAD. And it drives me crazy that we never will because they decided to reboot. They had something special here. They are idiots.(2 viewings, 3/21/2021, 6/14/2023)SPOILERSIn the original, the mother boxes were just a useless MacGuffin that I didn't care about. Now the mother boxes are actually a huge part of the story. In the original the villain was the most bland cookie cutter villain ever, now I actually know why he does what he does. In the original they took Superman to General Zod's ship to revive him with the mother box and none of that made sense to me but I just went with it and didn't ask questions. Now it makes way more sense.The scenes I imagine should be taken out are some of the scenes with Martha and Lois, the Martian Manhunter stuff, and some of the epilogue. I thought the epilogue was cool, but it was out of place here. And it makes it worse if they're not continuing this storyline, which as of now they are not.\",\n \"Zack snyder's justice league is far better than theatrical cut, in every way you can think of, steppenwolf is an actual threat now, his cgi is great, he has a clear goal, but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters, Snyder did each hero justice, and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing, Wonder woman is nothing like what we've seen in ww84, she is a valiant warrior and badass character, I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2, he is an absolute great villain, and junkie xl music is really epic and great, overall 9/10 for this movie, I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motions\\nNOW, it's time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE\",\n \"It was a fan service, period. Good on Snyder for doing it too, I can imagine what man had to go through these last few years. I enjoyed a lot of the extra back story, I treated the film like a short series, which I thought was the original idea. A lot of the original content was mildly interesting, but it felt like Amazing Spider-man 2, where there's a lot of story to tell, but it's never told. There's a lot of fans comparing this to the likes of Lord of the Rings, but even the extended filler content for middle-earth had character development and plot direction. You just don't get that in this film. There's A LOT of filler, for no reason. A lot of going somewhere, looking someplace, finding someone and action sequences that just made me yawn, or were totally cringe, and are great examples as to why certain scenes should be left on the cutting-room floor. As I mention, this film was a fan service, it was a 'take it as you will' movie that was almost finished, and still isn't. Which is why I give it the benefit of the doubt, it's not meant to be a theatrical release in the least, it's a 'what if' and for some that's satisfying, to others it can be a bit of a snooze fest. But, bravo regardless!\",\n \"There was a time I would go to the cinema, watch a movie like Superman II or Raiders of the Lost Ark. I would think I really liked that movie, could had done with another 30 minutes added on to it, what a ride.As I get older. Now when faced with the 3 hours long, The Avengers: Endgame. All I can think is will no one think of my bladder.There are countless examples of even 2 hour long movies nowadays where I think the director could had easily sliced 30 minutes off.This brings me to Zack Snyder's Justice League. All 4 hours of it.I planned to watch this over several days and to my surprise I did it all in one day.Although Justice League (2017) has Zack Snyder credited as the director. The film was largely reshot by Joss Whedon who delivered the final cut at 2 hours. Snyder has not even seen the movie.Fan pressure got the Zack Snyder cut released. It looks like everything Snyder shot is in it, some with better special effects added and Snyder even shot some new footage.This is a more coherent version. I remembered just how rushed some of the scenes were in Justice League and the accompanying music by Danny Elfman.In essence Whedon's rewrite and reshoots created a monster with two competing visions. Which then had to be heavily edited for a shorter running time.Snyder has been allowed to give his cut room to breath. The main beneficiaries are The Flash and Cyborg who have more of a backstory and utilised better here.Ray Fisher who played Cyborg has been pretty critical about how his character's part was reduced in Justice League and how he disliked the atmosphere created by Whedon.Steppenwolf also fares better in this movie with improved CGI. In Justice League I thought he was just a generic CGI villain.There are still some downsides. In the opening hostage scene with Wonder Woman. She could had disarmed the baddie as we can see she moves very fast. Instead Wonder Woman lets him reload his gun, all so she can blast him from the side of a building. How many people did the falling debris injure?When The Flash is running around near the speed of light. Cyborg is just standing there doing nothing, not even looking behind him to check if Steppenwolf is there. In fact there is a bit too much standing around in several action scenes when the mother box is the most important item to protect.Superman is still the casualty in both versions. A reduced role for the Man of Steel who has to return from the dead.There is no doubt in my mind this is the better version of Justice League. However the real challenge would had been could Snyder had delivered this movie with 90 minutes shaved off.\",\n \"It's way better than the original mess that was shown in cinemas a few years back. That doesn't make it a great film. Whilst motivations and characters get their chance to shine it's still a slow plodding exposition heavy cartoon. It seems some fans are bumping this up way higher than it deserves to be based purely on them being fans, or perhaps all they require is a coherent story to think a film is amazing? Who knows. It's an ok watch, just don't get caught up in the blind hype and you won't have your expectations ruined.\",\n 'The film is better than the \"original\" in pretty much every way, but only so much to bump the rating from the absolute \"1\" to the current \"5\".\\nA lot of pointless slow-motion scenes that serve no other purpose than to force some emotions and a forced dialogue that propagates the story without any reason to. If you are a fan of comic books and superheroes, then this film will probably please you. For the non-comics out there, this movie is a waste of time.',\n 'The story of \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman vs. Superman\" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and it\\'s perfect. Character buildup, plot, humor, climax, emotions in the movie is so great. It\\'s a sight for sore eyes.',\n \"Zack Snyder's Justice league is an excellent movie. It is however 4 hours long. And I never got bored watching any of it. It's a masterpiece and testament to Synder's vision for his movie that we should have gotten to see back in 2017. He fixed the problems with Justice League (2017) and improved upon them, must watch for any comic book fan.\",\n \"I loved the movie from the beggining to the end.Just like Ray fisher said,I was hoping that the movie doesn't end. The begging scene was mind blowing, liked that scene very much. Unlike 'the Justice League' the movie show every hero is best at their own thing, make us love every charecters.\\nThanks Zack and the whole team.\",\n \"This version is so much better than the originally released movie. At first, I didn't understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released, but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didn't add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League, go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original.\",\n \"If this was the original one released would you enjoy it? My answer is nope. Ppl are rating it high to try and prove it was worth making I guess. That being said It's certainly better than it's predecessor but falls extremely short of a good movie. The script is choppy, the music choice at times is mind blowingly awful, and I don't know who approves Snyder's use of slomo but they need to put a limit on how many times he is allowed to use it. This thing would've been ridiculed like BvS if joss' version was never created. The length does allow for Snyder to flesh out some characters, mostly the villains and cyborg. Yet somehow the film diminishes Aquaman and bats as characters. Four hours long and it still doesn't explain why there are goggles on Batman and why he has a random tank haha! Outside of that the only reason it's four hours long is because there is an hour worth of slomo! It's worth checking out if you were one clamoring for this version but don't expect Snyder to break away from all the stuff that made BvS terrible.\",\n 'Gonna keep this short. It was worth the wait, despite the DCU\\'s cinematic history and it\\'s inferior \"Josstice League\". It\\'s 4 hour runtime wisps by with its perfect pacing and attention to detail. This is definitely the definitive verison and Zack Snyders vision as intended. 10/10.',\n \"Reading through these reviews and everyone's giving it 9s and 10s , it's clear these guys no know nothing about films or Dc comics , the whole Snyders cut was heavily heavily teased centred around darkseid , but he doesn't actually make a proper appearance , in the teaser posters revealed in the trailer you're under the assumption the main focus will be darkseid but it's not. Feel like I've been scammed of 4 hours of my life , it's a good movie better than the first version , but the expectations were a bit too high.\",\n 'It is more than fans wanted from SnyderCut, it is visually pleasing and amazing cinematography along with a spectacular fresh score by Tom Holkenborg, 4 hours pass by so fast making us want more of SnyderVerse Taste.',\n 'I mean it is obvious that this version is far better than the 2017 cut by our friend JossAnyways I feel like the story is strechetd by slow mo and some dialogue (some times necessary, sometimes dont) but it is essencially the same movieThe 3rd Act feels far superior and the only point in the movie where we see a substancial change, anyhow, the 3 hours before tht part could have been just 1:30 or 2.Completely innecesary epilogue, not one but the 3 of them, just a los of loose ends in 10 minutes to hype some fanboys.',\n \"You can enjoy a movie and still critique it. If you're a specifically a snyder fan you might dig this. But for dc fans, superhero fans, or just casual movie fans\\nHeres some of the main issue's.-The music is very noticeable in the worst way. From jarring, unfit song choices, to wonderwomans choir music that shows up everytime shes on screen in battle. It becomes laughable.-The slowmo feels like it makes up half the movie. It works sometimes but it goes wayyy over the top.-The drawn-out overindulgence in scenes. The shots are often beautiful but go on for just so noticeably long. It, again, becomes almost laughable because it sticks out so much.-The flash. Now this was a problem in the original as well but the flashes speed is not felt at all. Ezra is great but the running is weird and just looks funny and tacky.-Although better than in the original cut, the main villian, Steppenwolf, is still bland and basic. And the overarching villian, Darkseid, is just as boring from the little bit we see of him.-The movie as a whole feels disjointed and very scrapped together. It feels too long because it should've been multiple movies but they put all of it in this one, so they're constantly jumping to different lands, worlds, timelines, and if you aren't an avid fan of DC and snyder films, you could quickly get lost or bored.-The story. I've seen others compare it to Avengers and Lord of the rings in terms of it's story and i can see that. It does nothing new, which is fine but if you aren't going to have an original story, you better have a damn good retelling of one. Justice league does not. It's just a lesser version of things you've already seen.-The epilogue coulda been scrapped all together and seems to serve as fan service and nothing more. There are scenes throughout the movie like this but the epilogue is the biggest example. It adds nothing of value. And the joker scene is possibly the worst in the film. Leto proves, once more, he does not work in the roll.Overall, I'm very happy snyder got to see his vision release, and it's definitely better than the theatrical cut. And I'm glad his fans got the farewell movie they wanted. That being said, as a dc fan and a movie fan, I'm also very happy we're moving away from these films and in this new direction of dark, r-rated dc films like Joker and Birds of Prey, The Batman and James gunns new Suicide Squad.\",\n \"Zack Snyder's Justice League is an EPIC in every sense of the word. From its incredible set peices to it's expertly crafted story telling this is the best film yet to come out of the DCEU (even though it's said not to be cannon) It's a complete satisfying package that leaves some interesting story threads. I'm hoping we now get Zacks JL2 and JL3 in the future. Because one things for sure now more than ever we will all be fighting for WB to Restore The Snyder Verse! Thank you Zack Snyder for showing us your amazing vision.\",\n \"The Snyder cut gave us an explanation to the story and to why is steppenwolf gathering the mother boxes and cyborg backstory and these two thing are the most important things that the original cut missed and what's even better that they removed all the silly jokes that was in the original movie\\nPositives:\\nEvery character took his right(main characters) , a better Batman, a more powerful steppenwolf with a purpose, the cgi has been improved and so much better than the original one , the soundtrack was amazing especially the wonder women one and the most positive thing is the fighting scenes\\nNegatives:\\nToo much slow motions\\nMy top 5 scenes\\n1-joker and the Batman dialogue\\n2-the flash time travel scene\\n3-steppenwolf vs the Amazons\\n4-darkside vs everyone\\n5-cyborg see the nightmare vision\\nThank you Snyder !#restorethesnyderverse.\"]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load reviews in a DataFrame and Score","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-17T15:41:47.735813Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-17T15:41:47.736196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-17T15:41:47.740517Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-17T15:41:47.736164Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-17T15:41:47.739541Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.DataFrame(np.array(reviews),columns=[\"Review\"])\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-17T15:43:08.978256Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-17T15:43:08.978609Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-17T15:43:08.989071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-17T15:43:08.978579Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-17T15:43:08.988159Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"execution_count":37,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                               Review\n0   As a life long comic fan, DC characters are mo...\n1   I don't want to discuss the Machiavellian mach...\n2   Zach Snyder's original version is 1000 x's bet...\n3   Yesss, thank you Zack Snyder!\\nTHIS is the mov...\n4   No words can describe the experience.
